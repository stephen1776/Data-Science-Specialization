# The Data Scientist’s Toolbox
#### Course Title: Data Scientist's Toolbox

#### Course Instructor: Jeff Leek
### Course Description:

In this course you will get an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the data scientists toolbox. The course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with. There are two components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge. The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git, Github, R, and Rstudio.

This course focuses primarily on getting you set up with the appropriate tools and accounts you will need for the rest of the specialization and on giving you a solid grounding in the key conceptual ideas. If you feel like the material is basic, that is ok, you will see much more in depth treatment of each topic in the subsequent courses in the track.

The Course Project

In the Course Project, you will demonstrate that you've set up all of the necessary accounts for the tools we'll be using.

You are required to evaluate and grade at least four of your classmates' projects. For this course, the project can be evaluated with a series of yes/no answers to determine whether people completed the required installations.

Part of the course project includes submitting a screenshot to demonstrate you have installed the relevant software. Be sure not to take a screenshot with other applications open that may reveal personal information or anything else you don't want others to see.
