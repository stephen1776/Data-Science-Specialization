## Course Title: Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Course Instructor: Roger D. Peng
### Course Description:

This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.
Course Content:

    Making exploratory graphs
    Principles of analytic graphics
    Plotting systems and graphics devices in R
    The base, lattice, and ggplot2 plotting systems in R
    Clustering methods
    Dimension reduction techniques

### Course Textbook

The book [Exploratory Data Analysis with R](https://leanpub.com/exdata) by Roger D. Peng covers the lecture material in this course.
Weekly quizzes

    There are two quizzes (Weeks 1 and 2).
    You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a quiz.
    You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hours.

    The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade.

### Course Projects

The two course projects will be assessed via peer assessment. In these projects, you will be asked to construct or reproduce certain plots, the purpose of which is to make you familiar with various plotting options. You will be evaluated on the plot that you produce and the code that you write to construct the plot. Course projects evaluated via peer assessment will make use of your GitHub account.

For each Course Project, you are required to evaluate and grade at least four of your classmates' projects.
Grading policy

You must score at least 80% on all assignments (Quizzes & Projects) to pass the course.

Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

    Quiz 1 = 20%
    Quiz 2 = 20%
    Course Project 1 = 25%
    Course Project 2 = 35%

### Weekly Descriptions

## Week 1
Week 1 covers the basics of analytic graphics and the base plotting system in R.

## Week 2
Week 2 covers some of the more advanced graphing systems available in R: the Lattice system and the ggplot2 system. While the base graphics system provides many important tools for visualizing data, it was part of the original R system and lacks many features that may be desirable in a plotting system, particularly when visualizing high dimensional data. The Lattice and ggplot2 systems also simplify the laying out of plots making it a much less tedious process.

## Week 3
Week 3 covers some of the workhorse statistical methods for exploratory analysis. These methods include clustering and dimension reduction techniques that allow you to make graphical displays of very high dimensional data (many many variables). We also cover novel ways to specify colors in R so that you can use color as an important and useful dimension when making data graphics. All of this material is covered in chapters 9-12 of the textbook [Exploratory Data Analysis with R](https://leanpub.com/exdata) by Roger D. Peng.

## Week 4
This week, we'll look at two case studies in exploratory data analysis. The first involves the use of cluster analysis techniques, and the second is a more involved analysis of some air pollution data. How one goes about doing EDA is often personal, but I'm providing these videos to give you a sense of how you might proceed with a specific type of dataset.
